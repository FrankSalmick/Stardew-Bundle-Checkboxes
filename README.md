# Stardew Bundle Checkboxes
This is an extension that will add checkboxes to the [stardew valley bundles wiki page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles). Use it to keep track of what you've turned in on the same page that tells you how to collect the items (and shows all the items on one screen). The checkboxes will stay checked if you close the tab or reload the page.
