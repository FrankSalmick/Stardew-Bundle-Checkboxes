# Stardew Bundle Checkboxes
This is an extension that will add checkboxes to the [stardew valley bundles wiki page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bundles). Use it to keep track of what you've turned in on the same page that tells you how to collect the items (and shows all the items on one screen).

# Install
The chrome webstore does a manual review of extensions and it usually takes 2-3 days. I'll add a link when it goes through but for now you can just download stardew.zip, navigate to chrome://extensions, click the "Developer mode" radio button in the top right, and drag the zip folder onto the page (or click Load unpacked in the top left). No need to unzip the folder.
